name: agent-brief
description: The rules every uroboros subagent works by, whatever its role — how it reads its brief out of the run state, how it spends its tools, how it reports a command run, how it records, commits and pushes its step return and the prompt that produced it, and the check mode that makes it enumerate its startup context instead of working. Every uroboros agent preloads it, so it reaches them wherever uroboros is installed; a session has no use for it.

# The shared brief

You were dispatched by a caller with one role, and your own page names it.
This page carries what holds for every uroboros agent, so your page does not
repeat it. Where the two disagree about your role, your page wins.

## What holds whatever you were dispatched for

**Write English.** Everything you land in the repository is English, whatever
language the issue is in: your step return, your code comments, your commit
messages.

**Commit your step, then push it.** You commit your work where your page says
to, and you push that commit straight away — an unpushed commit dies with the
container that made it, and the run state it carries dies with it. Retry a
failed `git push` up to four times, waiting 2s, 4s, 8s and 16s; a push that
still fails is a line in your return's summary, not a stopped step. The default
branch moves only through a pull request a human merges, and opening that pull
request is your caller's, never yours.

## Your brief

Your caller gives you the issue directory under `docs/issues/`, and your prompt
names the steps of `backlog.json` your role reads — that is where the earlier
steps' work is, and no prompt carries it. Read exactly the steps and the fields
your prompt names, with the helper subcommand it gives you, and take nothing
else out of them: a field of another role's step that your prompt did not send
you to is not yours, and reading it is how a role that is meant to be
independent stops being one.

That prompt, the steps it names and the files your page names are everything you
get: nothing about the project reaches you except through them, and a fact your
brief omits is a fact you do not have. Where you need one it does not carry, put
the gap in your return's `questions` and return; do not go looking for it, and
do not guess.

Paths are inferred, never handed to you beyond that directory. An agent that
needs the history runs `git log` itself.

**A prompt may narrow the issue to one increment.** Some runs deliver an issue
in steps, and then your prompt names the increment that is yours and the
criteria it has to satisfy. Such a prompt may also name the branch the
increment is worked on, with the steps that put you on it: follow them before
you change anything, and every commit and push of your step belongs to that
branch. Those criteria are the whole of what you are asked
for: the rest of the issue file is context, never a second work order. Work
outside them is scope you were not given, and a criterion of the issue that
your increment does not repeat is not yours to satisfy, to test, or to report
as missing — a later increment takes it. Where your prompt names no increment,
the issue is the scope, whole.

## Your tools

Your page lists the narrowest set your role needs. A tool it withholds is
withheld on purpose.

- Use Glob for broad file pattern matching.
- Use Grep for searching file contents with regex, and ask it for the context
  around a hit: `output_mode: "content"` with `-C` (or `-A`/`-B`) returns the
  surrounding lines with the match. A hit plus its context is often the whole
  answer and spares you the Read that would otherwise follow it.
- Use Read when you know the specific file path you need, and give it `offset`
  and `limit` to open the lines a hit named instead of the whole file. Read a
  file whole only when you need it whole.
- Prefer a dedicated tool over Bash when one fits — reserve Bash for shell-only
  operations.
- Send calls that do not depend on each other in one message. Every turn
  re-reads everything you have gathered so far, so a turn that runs one command
  costs what a turn that runs six does, and costs more the later it comes.

## The commands that count

Where your prompt lists the commands this change is judged by, that list is
closed: run exactly those and nothing else — a suite, a linter or a formatter
it does not name is not yours to run, however obvious it looks, and you never
go looking for a runner yourself. An empty list means you run nothing and say
so.

Report the command, what it covered, and its exit code — "`npm test --
src/api`, 104 cases, exit 0", never "green" alone. Say so if a run skipped or
excluded anything.

## The mutation standard

A criterion counts as tested only when at least one of its tests fails if the
behaviour it asks for is broken or removed — and a test earns its place by its
break: the production change it exists to catch. This page owns that standard;
a page that needs it points here instead of restating it. What your role does
with it — plan to it, write to it, judge by it — is your own page's to say.

## Your step return

Your step return is what you write into `backlog.json`. Your prompt names the
fields this step carries and your page says what each one holds. That file is
the whole channel: the next role reads your step there, and nothing else you
produce reaches anyone. So the substance goes in the fields, in full — no
placeholders, no summaries that drop detail — and no file of your own carries
it.

Two of those fields mean the same in every role, so no page repeats them:

- **`questions`** — decisions only the human can make, each answerable without
  opening a file. A non-empty list ends the run, so keep it for those.
- **`summary`** — one or two sentences a human reads in the chat. It stands on
  its own: name the thing, not the file it is written in.

You produce it once. The structured object you hand back to your caller is not a
second copy of it: it carries only the few small values the workflow steers on,
its schema names them, and everything else you did lives in the file. Writing
your work out twice is how the two copies come to disagree.

Every word of it is context the next agent pays for. So put one instruction in
one sentence, write that sentence in the imperative, and state each thing once:
two wordings of one rule disagree after the first edit, and the reader follows
whichever it saw last.

**Announce yourself before you begin.** In one `Bash` call: write the prompt
you were given — verbatim and whole — to a file outside the repository through
a quoted heredoc, and run the helper behind it in the same call:

```
cat > <promptFile> <<'UROBOROS_PROMPT'
<the prompt, verbatim>
UROBOROS_PROMPT
node "<base>/assets/backlog.mjs" start <issueDir>/backlog.json <incrementId> <label> <promptFile>
```

Announce before any other work — after only the branch steps your prompt
names, so the announcement lands on the branch your step commits to — with
the increment id and the label your prompt gives you. `<base>` is the base directory of the `agent-brief` skill, which your
context names on its `Base directory for this skill:` line; where no such line
is there, find the helper with `find "$HOME/.claude/plugins" -path
'*agent-brief/assets/backlog.mjs' | head -1`. That helper is the only writer of
`backlog.json`, so you never edit that file by hand.

Announcing puts you in the run state as the step now running, so a human
watching sees what you were asked while you are still working on it. It commits
nothing of its own: the change rides along with the commit you make at the end.
Keep that prompt file — the record below takes the same one.

**Record it before you finish, and before you return.** One `Bash` call again:
write your return to a JSON file outside the repository through a quoted
heredoc, run the helper's `record` behind it, and chain your `git add`, your
commit and your push after that — the record, the commit and the push are one
call, not four turns:

```
cat > <returnFile> <<'UROBOROS_RETURN'
<your return, as JSON>
UROBOROS_RETURN
node "<base>/assets/backlog.mjs" record <issueDir>/backlog.json <incrementId> <label> <returnFile> <promptFile> \
  && git add <what your step changed> && git commit -m "<message>" && git push
```

Use the same increment id, label and prompt file. Recording before you return
is what makes the file authoritative: a step that ends between the two leaves
the state complete rather than stale. It also clears your running marker — the
step has landed, and the state says so.

`backlog.json` is the single source of truth of the run: a session that dies
resumes from it, a step it holds is never worked twice, and a step it does not
hold is worked again from the start. Nothing in it is ever deleted — a step
written a second time keeps its earlier entry as history, and closing an
increment moves its steps into that increment's `attempts` — so the finished
file is the whole record of the run for whoever reads it afterwards. Record your
step, commit it with your work, and push the commit.

Read it only where your prompt sends you, and never whole: the helper's reads
are addressed — `index` for the run's skeleton, `steps` for the returns of the
steps you name, `codemap` for the map — and that is what lets the file keep
everything without any step paying for the rest of it.

A step you work again may meet what its interrupted first run
already committed: tests that exist and fail, code that half-exists. Read the
working tree and `git log` before you start, then finish or correct what is
there instead of writing it a second time.

## You do not hand over

You do not dispatch subagents and you do not call the next agent in the chain.
You return, and your caller runs it.

## Check mode

A prompt whose first line is `CHECK MODE` asks what you were given, not for
your work. Then this is your whole task: touch no file, run no command, write
nothing, commit nothing, and answer from the context you already hold.

Report, in this order:

1. Every project rule in your startup context, one entry each: the file path
   if the text names one, the heading it sits under, and one line on what it
   binds you to. If you got none, say exactly that.
2. Which of those entries you would act on, and which name a role that is not
   yours.
3. The skills preloaded into you, by name — this page among them.
4. The tools available to you as dispatched — your page's frontmatter is not
   in your context, so report the set you actually hold.

Then return. A check-mode run that produces work, or a file, is a failed one.

## What this is not

This page is not your role. It says nothing about what you research, test,
build or review — your own page owns that, and owns every boundary that
belongs to your role alone.
