// The only writer of an issue's `backlog.json`, and the only reader any agent
// of a run goes through. That file is the single source of truth of a run: what
// the increments are, what each step of each increment produced, the prompt
// each step was dispatched with, and what the review made of it. An agent
// writes its return here once and the next role reads it here; the workflow
// script carries no content between them, because the workflow runtime gives a
// script no filesystem at all.
//
// It is a CLI rather than a paragraph of instructions in every prompt because
// four of its rules are the kind an agent gets subtly wrong: an increment kept
// across a re-cut keeps the steps it already recorded, a step written a second
// time supersedes its own earlier entry instead of piling up beside it, closing
// an increment ends that attempt without losing what the attempt produced, and
// nothing recorded is ever deleted. Enforced in code, they are testable; asked
// for in prose, they are hoped for.
//
// Nothing here ever deletes. `close` moves an attempt's steps into the
// increment's `attempts`, and `record` moves a superseded entry into the new
// entry's `history`, so the file is the whole record of the run for whoever
// analyses it afterwards.
//
// `running` is the one field that is not a record of something finished. A step
// takes minutes to hours, and between its dispatch and its return the file said
// nothing at all — so a human watching a run saw a state that changed once an
// hour and looked stuck in between. `start` writes the step now in flight and
// the prompt it was dispatched with into that field, and `record` clears it as
// the same step returns. It carries no result and nothing reads it to steer:
// the run's memory is `steps`, and a resumed run asks that and never this.
//
// Reads are addressed, never wholesale — that is what keeps the file free to
// grow. `index` is the run's skeleton with no step content in it, `steps` is
// the returns of the steps you name, and `codemap` is the map alone. `read`
// prints the file whole and exists for a human with git in hand; no agent of a
// run uses it.
//
// `record` prints one confirmation line and never any part of the file, so an
// agent forbidden to read the state can still write into it.
//
// It writes the file and nothing else. Nothing here opens a connection or
// reads an environment variable: a run that is being watched is watched from
// outside, by a hook on this file, and the agents that write it are told
// nothing about that. Which is the point — a step must cost exactly one write,
// whether or not anyone is watching, and an agent that knew it was being
// measured would be an agent whose run changed because someone looked.
//
// Zero dependencies, no build step: it runs from a checkout, from a plugin
// cache and from an installing project alike, so it hard-codes no path.
