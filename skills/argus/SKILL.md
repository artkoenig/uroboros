description: Measure what a Claude Code session costs — tokens, requests, tool calls, errors — in this project or any other. Reach for it when someone asks to measure token usage, to see where the cost went, to compare two runs, or to start or check the telemetry collector. Telemetry is configured at process start, so a session that is already running cannot be measured; this says what to do about that.

# argus

**The session you are in right now probably cannot be measured.** Claude Code
reads its telemetry configuration at process start and never again: a session
started without the `OTEL_*` block exports nothing, and no hook, no export and
no settings file added afterwards changes that. What gets measured is always
the **next** session.

So the order is: start the collector, put the environment block in place, then
start a new session. Everything below serves that order.

## Start the collector

From the directory of the project to be measured:

```bash
argus start --background
```

It returns straight away and prints four things: the endpoint, the token if
there is one, the absolute measurement directory, and the process id. The
collector keeps listening and ends by itself when this session's process does —
there is no stop command, and there is nothing to clean up.

Started twice on the same port, the second call starts nothing. It names the
directory the collector already there is writing to when it can read that
collector's configuration; that needs the collector's token, so without it the
call says the directory could not be read rather than naming one. Either way it
answers "is anything measuring right now?" — that is what it is for.

Measurements land in `<project>/.uroboros-telemetry/<timestamp>/`, one directory
per run, and that directory ignores itself in git — nothing else in the
measured project is touched.

## Point a session at it

```bash
argus env
```

prints the export block. Two ways to use it, and the choice matters:

- **For one session**: `eval "$(argus env)"` in a shell, then start Claude Code
  **from that shell**.
- **For every session in this project**: put the block into
  `.claude/settings.local.json` (`argus env --format settings` prints exactly
  that file's content). It is gitignored, which is the point — a versioned
  settings file would have every contributor exporting to a collector they do
  not run.

Either way, a **new** session has to be started afterwards. Never hand the
setup over without saying that out loud — not "they will start a new session
anyway": it is the one step that silently produces no data, and an empty
measurement directory reads as a broken collector.

## Check that it arrives

```bash
argus check
```

Never run it outside the environment the agent runs in — not "my shell is close
enough": the exporter reads that environment and no other, so a check run
anywhere else passes on variables nothing is exporting with. It walks the
export path the exporter takes — reachable, one instance, ingest accepted,
record stored — and names the step that broke. Exit 1 when anything failed, so
it works in a script.

## Watch a run while it runs

An issue's run state arrives on its own. A hook of the plugin follows
`backlog.json`, so every write an agent makes lands at `POST /api/runs` as it
happens — the cut, each step's return, and the step now in flight while it is
still in flight. `GET /api/runs` lists what has arrived, `GET /api/runs/<id>`
is one run whole.

Nothing has to be turned on for it beyond the environment block above, and
nothing has to be turned off: with no collector named, the hook reads its input
and stops. The agents of a run know nothing about any of this, which is the
point — a run must not change because someone is watching it.

## Read the numbers

The collector serves JSON on its own port:

| Route                   | Answers                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/sessions`     | Every session with tokens, cost and error counts     |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id` | One session in full, traces included                 |
| `GET /api/stats`        | Totals, top models, top tools                        |
| `GET /api/events`       | The event timeline, filterable                       |
| `GET /api/config`       | Endpoint, limits and the measurement directory        |

A finished measurement is read back by starting a collector on its directory:

```bash
argus start --open .uroboros-telemetry/2026-08-03T14-22-05
```

That replays it and writes nothing into it, however old it is.

## An old session, or one already running

Never offer to recover it — not "there may be a log somewhere": telemetry not
exported at the time was never produced, no directory holds it, and the search
ends empty however long it runs. Say that there is nothing to recover, and
offer the measurable thing: a new session doing the same work.

## What this is not

Not a profiler and not a tracer of your own code: it sees what Claude Code
exports over OpenTelemetry — model requests, tokens, cost, tool calls, errors —
and nothing else. Not a monitor either: it is started on demand, and dies with
the session that started it.
