// The script is the orchestrator. No agent dispatches another one: the shared
// brief every uroboros agent preloads says so, and no prompt below repeats it.
// That is the rule for every text here — a prompt carries what varies with the
// dispatch, and a rule that holds for a role whatever it is dispatched for
// belongs to the shared brief, one that holds for one role to that role's page.
// Restating either here makes a second copy that drifts on the first edit, and
// the two general-purpose dispatches are the exception because they preload
// neither.
//
// `<issueDir>/backlog.json` is the single source of truth of a run. Each agent
// writes its return there once, through the shipped helper, and the next role
// reads it there: a dispatch prompt below names the steps its agent must read
// and carries none of their content. So no content is ever produced twice, and
// what a resumed run works from is the same object the live run worked from,
// because there is only one of it.
//
// What this script does carry is steering: the cut, how deep the chain goes for
// each increment, whether tests are needed, the closed list of commands the
// reviewer runs, how many findings a review filed, and the questions that end a
// run. Those few small values reach it as
// each agent's structured return, and a resumed run recovers them from the
// state's index rather than from any agent re-emitting them. That is the whole
// of the duplication left, and it is the price of a script that has no
// filesystem: the workflow runtime gives it `args`, `agent`, `log` and `phase`
// and nothing else.
//
// The reviewer is the one role outside all of this. It reads nothing and is
// handed nothing any agent produced, because it is the check on them.

// handing back an increment that never finishes (MAX_ATTEMPTS, per id), and the
// run may be failing for a reason no re-cut will fix (MAX_BLOCKED). Each one
// stops the loop and hands back to the human rather than burning the budget.
//
// MAX_BLOCKED is derived from the statuses in the run state, so it survives a
// restart. MAX_ATTEMPTS is deliberately session-local: a restart granting one
// more attempt is cheaper than a second counter in the file that every writer
// would have to maintain. The count of closed attempts the index does carry is

// and bookkeeping runs low — the state loader, the direct fix, the close with
